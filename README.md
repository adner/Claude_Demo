### Self healing plugins in Dataverse using MCP, Claude Code and Github Actions

This repo contains the code and configuration for the demo I posted to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andreas-adner-70b1153_claudecode-github-copilot-activity-7340113552575193089-MU7B?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAACM8rsBEgQIrYgb4NZAbnxwfDRk_Tu5e3w), demonstrating how to use Claude Code to 'self heal' Dataverse plugin issues, using an MCP Server.

For more information, as well as detailed setup instructions - see my [blog post](https://nullpointer.se/dataverse/mcp/2025/07/06/dataverse-mcp-claude.html).
